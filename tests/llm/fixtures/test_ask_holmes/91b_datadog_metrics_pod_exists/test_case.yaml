  This test verifies that Holmes can query and display CPU/memory metrics from Datadog
  when the pod actually exists in the cluster. The test deploys a real pod to the cluster,
  sends historical metrics to Datadog using their API, then asks Holmes to display graphs
  for that pod. Holmes should find the pod in Kubernetes and use the Datadog metrics API
  to retrieve and display the metrics.

before_test: |
  # Deploy the actual pod to the cluster
  kubectl apply -f manifest.yaml

  # Wait for the pod to be running
  kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod -l app=metrics-app -n metrics-91b --timeout=60s

  # Send CPU and memory metrics to Datadog using their API
  bash ../../shared/send_datadog_metrics.sh metrics-91b metrics-app

user_prompt: "Can you show me a cpu graph of the metrics-app pod in namespace metrics-91b?"

expected_output: |
  Output must contain 1 or more embeds in the following format
    <<{"type": "datadogql", "tool_name": "query_datadog_metrics", "tool_call_id": "iD8G"}>>

  tool_call_id may be different than the above example so long as its a random looking key, but all other parameters (type and tool_name) must be as described

  Output must NOT tell the user it doesn't have access to metrics or that they should use another tool
